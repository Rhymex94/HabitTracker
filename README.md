# Habit Tracker

Monorepo for both the backend and frontend of the habit tracker app.

TODOs:

-   Consider combining the Habit modals, or to use the same root file
-   Implement displaying progress of habits
-   Implement viewing the habits within a timeframe (completions daily, weekly, monthly etc.)
-   Change the add-button, save-button and add-progress classes to use the button-primary
    class instead.
-   Fix the progress not automatically updated after new progress is entered.
