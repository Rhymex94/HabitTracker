# Habit Tracker

Monorepo for both the backend and frontend of the habit tracker app.

TODOs:
* Consider combining the Habit modals, or to use the same root file
* Implement adding progress to the habits
* Implement a simple progress page: overview of which habits are reached within a 
    timeframe (today, this week, this month etc.)
