# Habit Tracker

Monorepo for both the backend and frontend of the habit tracker app.

TODOs:

-   Consider combining the Habit modals, or to use the same root file
-   Implement a streak view of habits:
    -   Percentage of completed days/weeks/months/years
    -   Max and current streaks of completions
-   Change the add-button, save-button and add-progress classes to use the button-primary
    class instead.
- Make the binary add-progress buttons context specific (better copy)
