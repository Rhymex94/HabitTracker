# Habit Tracker

Monorepo for both the backend and frontend of the habit tracker app.

TODOs:

-   Consider combining the Habit modals, or to use the same root file
-   Implement completing binary-type habits
-   Implement displaying progress of habits
-   Implement viewing the habits within a timeframe (completions daily, weekly, monthly etc.)
